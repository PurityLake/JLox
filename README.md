# JLox
Java implementation of the Lox language for the Crafting Interpreters book.

Following along with the Crafting Interpreters book. Will add little bits and pieces to the language as exercises.

# Notice
Compile errors will show up but when you run the code for the first time it will auto generate the files needed.
